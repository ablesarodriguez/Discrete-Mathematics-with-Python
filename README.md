# Discrete-Mathematics-with-Python
## Course Description

This subject covered mathematical concepts that are fundamental to computing, such as logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.

## Practical Work

The course was structured around five seminars, each focusing on different problem-solving techniques:

- **Seminar 1: Probability Analysis** – We calculated probabilities of answering multiple-choice questions correctly, both manually and through simulation using Python. We explored the impact of guessing on exam performance.

- **Seminar 2: Graph Theory Foundations** – We modeled social networks and messaging apps using graph structures. We implemented graph representations and explored connectivity and communication constraints.

- **Seminar 3: Web Crawler Simulation** – We designed an algorithm to traverse a network of interconnected web pages, simulating how search engines index the internet using BFS and DFS.

- **Seminar 4: Shortest Path Algorithms** – We worked with weighted graphs to find the shortest paths between nodes, applying Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve real-world navigation problems.

- **Seminar 5: Eulerian and Hamiltonian Graphs** – We analyzed networks to determine whether they contained Eulerian or Hamiltonian paths, applying Hierholzer’s algorithm to find Eulerian circuits.
